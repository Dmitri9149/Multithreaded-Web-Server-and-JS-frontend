Simple multithreaded web server written in Rust with Java Script frontend. 
The base code of the backend is taken from the [The Rust Book, Building a Multithreaded Web Server](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).  
This is NOT one page fullstack application.  
The vanilla Java Script is used for the Frontend.   
The project is intended mainly to test different Rust web frameworks, Rust backend / vanilla Java Script frontend combinations.
Run it with 
```
cargo run 
```   
from the root of the project.
